This section will be dedicated to learning how dynamic programming works and practicing it, most solutions will not be 100% made from me. I will only post the solutions that I understood and I feel I can apply in an interview as to keep this fair for myself. I will attempt to post 50 different DP solutions with my thought process and techniques I learned throughout each problem. 

The 50 problems will be chosen from: https://blog.usejournal.com/top-50-dynamic-programming-practice-problems-4208fed71aa3 

Here are some resources I found on DP that helped me understand more about the subject (will add more as I go):
